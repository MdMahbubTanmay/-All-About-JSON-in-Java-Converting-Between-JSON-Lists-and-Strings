# All About JSON in Java: Converting Between JSON, Lists, and Strings

This repository contains a comprehensive class note for working with JSON in Java, including examples of converting JSON to lists, lists to JSON, strings to JSON, and JSON to strings. The code demonstrates practical usage of the `org.json` library and covers:

- Creating and manipulating `JSONArray` and `JSONObject`
- Converting between Java `List` and `JSONArray` (both single and nested/multi-dimensional)
- Parsing JSON from strings
- Serializing JSON to strings
- Handling nested arrays and objects
